                        <p>We provide a way for the end user (<b>“Customer”</b>) to communicate his or her reservations
                            for surplus food and other surplus products (<b>“Products”</b>) at food stores, restaurants, supermarkets, bakeries, hotels, gas
                            stations, etc. (<b>“Stores”</b>) displayed on our platform (the “<b>Service</b>”).</p>
                        <p>These terms and conditions (<b>“Terms”</b>) apply to any reservation and sale of the Products
                            which are carried out via <a href="https://toogoodtogo.com">our websites</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>When placing a Reservation Order (as defined below), the Customer accepts these Terms and
                            thus, the Customer is required to review the Terms thoroughly before the Customer places an
                            order on the Platform.</p>
                        <p>SF’s cookie and privacy policy, as available at all times on the Platform, shall form an

                        <p>The Products are made available for reservation on the Platform, and Customers may reserve
                            the Products by placing a Reservation Order (as defined below) on the Platform.</p>
                        <p>The Products are reserved by the Customer when SF confirms through a Reservation
                            Confirmation (as defined below).</p>
                        <p>Once a Customer reserves a Product and the Store accepts the Reservation, the Customer
                            commits to be present at the Store at the Pick-up time (as defined below) while the Store
                            commits to offer the Products for sale, as specified herein. Both parties have a right of
                            cancellation as defined below.</p>
                        <p>SF is solely arranging the sale of Products on the Platform on behalf of a Store, and there
                            shall be no contractual relationship between SF and the Customer with regard to the
                            Products or the sale of Products. SF has no responsibilities in respect of the Products or

                        <p>SF is solely collecting the Purchase Price (as defined below) for the Products on behalf of
                            the Store and is thus merely acting as a payment agent on behalf of the Store.</p>

                            and the Customer.</p>
                        <p>SF does not, in any way, manufacture, sell, purchase, store, prepare, produce, process,
                            mark, pack, deliver or handle the Products. SF has no responsibility for the fulfilment of
                            the contractual obligations towards the Customer regarding the Products, including the
                            manufacturing, sale, purchase, storage, preparation, production, processing, marking,

                            with applicable legislation, including with respect to the above, unless SF is explicitly
                            designated as the manufacturer or seller of the Product on the Platform.</p>
                        <p>The Customer can find information about the Products and a description of the Products on the
                            Platform. This information is only instructive and for the purpose of giving the Customer
                            the best prerequisites for evaluating selected Products before making the reservation. There
                            may be instances where the Platform is not updated and where the actual product range,
                            stocked items etc. is not as stated on the Platform. In such cases, SF is of no liability.
                            It is the Stores that are responsible for providing information about the Products and to
                            ensure that it is factually accurate and up-to-date. SF does not undertake any such
                            responsibility and, hence, has no liability for the contents of or availability of

                        <p>If the Customer is in doubt about allergy warnings, contents of a dish or any other menu
                            information, the Customer shall confirm with the Store directly before ordering. The Store’s
                            contact information will appear on the Platform. The Customer may always cancel the
                            Reservation Order, if the cancelation is due to ingredients, allergens or other labelling
                            related information regarding the Product.</p>
                        <p>Upon Pick-up (as defined below), the Store shall provide the Customer with information

                        <p>A list of active Stores can be found in the app. If the Customer has allowed the app to use
                            location services, the app will track the Customer’s location and the list will show stores
                            near the Customer. Once the Customer has selected the Store and Product, the Customer will
                            be given the opportunity to submit his or her order by clicking “reserve”, “place my
                            reservation” or a similar button.</p>
                        <p>The list is solely established in consideration of a geographical criteria. The Customer has
                            the possibility to filter the results in consideration of the availability of Products to
                            reserve, of the Pick-up hour, of the nature of Products contained in “Packs”, or as

                        <p>The referenced Stores are the ones who are active on the Platform.</p>
                        <p>The supply of Products on the Platform is only an invitation to the Customer to place a

                        <p>A reservation order made by the Customer via the Platform (<b>“Reservation Order”</b>) is
                            considered an offer by the Customer to the Store to purchase a Product.</p>
                        <p>The Reservation Order shall be accepted by the Store upon Pick-up and, hence, the reservation
                            shall be final and binding upon the Store and Customer upon Pick-up of the Product (as
                            defined below), subject, however, to the limitations in the cancellation rights due to the
                            nature of the Concept, as described in clause 7 below.</p>

                            has been received (<b>“Reservation Confirmation”</b>) and is being processed. Please note
                            that any confirmation page that the Customer may visit on the Platform merely indicates that
                            the reservation has been received and is being processed and does not mean that the
                            reservation has been accepted by the Store</p>
                        <p>The Reservation Confirmation should be saved by the Customer. The Reservation Confirmation
                            will contain information regarding the reservation placed by the Customer.</p>

                        <p>SF’s concept is to avoid waste of food and other products and therefore, if the Store has
                            no Products in excess, the Store may cancel the Reservation Order up until two hours before
                            the beginning of the agreed time of Pick-up (as described below). In this case, the Customer
                            will receive a cancellation notification from SF or the Store via email and/or SMS/and or
                            a notification from the Platform provided that the contact information provided to SF is
                            correct, and that the Costumer has agreed to receiving such notifications.</p>
                        <p>Since the Products are perishable goods and since SF’s concept is to avoid waste of food
                            and other products, the Customer can only cancel the Reservation Order up until two hours
                            before the beginning of the agreed time of Pick-up. However, the Customer may cancel the
                            Reservation Order until Pick-up, if the cancelation is due to ingredients, allergens or
                            other labelling related information regarding the Product.</p>
                        <p>The decision to use the right to cancellation shall be communicated by the Customer to SF
                            via the complaint link in the Platform. If the Customer cancels the Reservation order
                            outside of the rights set out above, the Customer will not be entitled to refund.</p>

                        <p>Products reserved on the Platform must be picked-up by the Customer at the stated pick-up
                            address (<b>“Pick-up”</b>). The Pick-up time will normally be in a time period of 10-30
                            minutes but can be both shorter and longer. Store description and details about when and
                            where the Products can be picked up will appear on the Platform and is stated in the
                            Reservation Confirmation as well. If the Customer arrives at the Pick-up address before the
                            specified pick-up time, we ask him or her to please wait outside for the sake of the Store’s
                            guests. Be aware that if the Customer arrives too late, the Store may be closed and/or the
                            Product may be unavailable.</p>
                        <p>Since the Products are perishable goods and since SF’s concept is to avoid waste of food
                            and other products, the Store is entitled to sell the Product to another customer if the
                            Customer does not Pick-up the Reservation Order within the time period set out in the
                            Reservation Confirmation. In this event, SF is entitled to charge the Purchase Price (as
                            defined below) from the Customer.</p>
                        <p>Upon Pick-up, the Customer shall show his or her Reservation Confirmation in the SF app to
                            the Store’s employees, after which they will “swipe” the receipt and hand out the Products
                            reserved. It is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that the Reservation Confirmation in

                        <p>The Customer can pay with several brands of debit and credit cards as well as other payment
                            methods made available on the Platform.</p>
                        <p>If using credit or debit card, the Customer must enter his or her card number, the expiration
                            date and the security code when placing a Reservation Order.</p>
                        <p>Upon placing a Reservation Order, the amount stipulated by the Store for the Products (<b>“Purchase
                                Price”</b>) is authorized or reserved at the Customer´s account (depending on the chosen
                            payment method) (<b>“Account”</b>). The Purchase Price is charged at the Customer´s account
                            upon reservation of the Product or at or immediately after Pick-up (depending on the chosen
                            method of payment). If the reservation is cancelled in accordance with these Terms, the
                            Purchase Price is cancelled or refunded to Customer.</p>
                        <p>The Purchase Price is collected by SF from the Customer on behalf of the Store. SF may
                            amend, modify or restructure the payment procedure for its Customers, as it deems
                            reasonable.</p>
                        <p>The Platform uses PCI compliant Payment Service Providers. Payment by debit or credit card on
                            the Platform is safe and certified by the card issuer. All payments are made through an
                            encrypted internet connection.</p>
                        <p>SF does not store any debit or credit card information. Such information is handled by the
                            Payment Service Providers. However, such information may be stored by the Payment Service
                            Providers.</p>
                        <p>If the Customer’s credit card or payment method is rejected when trying to pay for an order,
                            the Customer should verify that the entered information is correct.</p>
                        <p>If the Customer has corrected the error and the credit card is still rejected, SF
                            recommends that the Customer contacts his or her bank.</p>
                        <p>Due to standard banking procedures, once the Customer has submitted a Reservation Order by
                            use of a credit or debit card and the payment has been authorized, the bank or card issuer
                            will reserve the full amount of the Reservation Order If the Reservation Order is
                            subsequently rejected by the Store or cancelled for any other reason in accordance with
                            these Terms, the bank or card issuer will not transfer the funds for the order to SF and
                            will instead refund the Customer by releasing the relevant amount back into the Customer’s
                            available balance. However, this may take up to 10 working days (or longer, depending on the
                            Customer’s bank or card issuer), and SF does not have authority to make enquiries to a
                            Customer’s bank or card issuer on specific payment issues. The Customer must do so.</p>
                        <p>By accepting these Terms, the Customer accepts the method of payment set out above and
                            acknowledges and agrees that SF is not responsible or liable to the Customer in relation
                            to the above.</p>

                        <p>In case of a complaint concerning a Product, the
                            Customer shall address the complaint to the Customer Service of SF before considering any
                            other action. SF will handle all claims as SF deems correct and any decision by SF regarding the Product is
                            entirely up to SF.</p>
                        <p>In the event that the intervention of SF is not to the satisfaction of the Customer, these
                            Terms do not limit the means available to the Customer to resolve the dispute it has with
                            the Store under statutory law. The Services are covered by statutory consumer protection
                            legislation and other statutory legislation regarding purchase of goods (in Belgium
                            Brussels) and provisions set out herein regarding defects and delays.</p>
                        <p>All complaints are handled exclusively by SF and the Customer shall direct complaints
                            against SF and not the Store.</p>
                        <p>The Customer shall verify the content of the Products upon receipt.</p>
                        <p>In case of a complaint, the Customer shall contact SF via the complaint link on the
                            Platform and provide the requested information and information about the Products and why
                            the Customer is unsatisfied. After receiving the complaint, SF will process the complaint
                            in cooperation with the Store if relevant and the Customer will receive a reply from SF
                            within 10 business days.</p>
                        <p>In case the Customer is not satisfied with SF’s reply, the Customer may submit a complaint
                            to the relevant consumer protection authority (in Belgium Brussels).</p>
